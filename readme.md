### About this project 
I created this quick CLI game after watching the movie Curs>d on Netflix. It was a fun and quick way to learn GO and thought someone out there might enjoy it. I implore you to run the binary without checking the code as it would give you the answers to the game but I also understand the security implications of that, so either way feel free and I hope you enjoy :)
